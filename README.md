This is my repository for all things related to my OPD Genealogy Research.

Step 1. Create a Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
# Here is a little about me and why I created this repository.

Welcome to Glitch - This is my copy of the README.md file to learn a little about the markdown syntax.

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

Your Project
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it. I guess this is where I edit the readme.md file. I guess I need to know some of the markdown tags, huh?

### ← index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website. 

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ← script.js

If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
